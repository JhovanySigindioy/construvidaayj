Hello, my name is Wilima Jhovany Sigindioy Miticanoy, ID number 1124853578. I am enrolled in the program TECHNICIAN IN MOBILE APPLICATION PROGRAMMING, with English transversal instructor, GLORIA MARCELA CATAÑO GARCÍA. This audio is part of activity 8, Create Audio, where I will express my attitudes, beliefs, and obligations in both my work and academic contexts.
In my work context, I have to follow a strict schedule. I must complete my tasks on time and communicate effectively with my team. I believe that punctuality and responsibility are essential values in any professional setting. For example, I have to arrive on time for meetings and meet deadlines. These are obligations that I take seriously because they help maintain the workflow and build trust with colleagues.
In my academic context, I also have to be disciplined and organized. I should complete my assignments on time and actively participate in class. I believe that continuous learning is important for personal growth, and I must focus on improving my skills every day. For instance, I must review my notes and study regularly, as these actions help me perform better in exams and contribute to my development.
In conclusion, whether in my work or academic life, I have to maintain a balance between fulfilling my responsibilities and growing as a professional and individual. I believe that hard work, discipline, and commitment are the key elements to succeed in both areas.
